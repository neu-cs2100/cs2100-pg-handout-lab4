Please fill out a stakeholder-value matrix for one of these three apps:
- A dog walking app, where workers can offer their services, and clients reach out to schedule the dog walking
- An app focused on financial transactions, which added a "social media" aspect (friend requests, statuses, news feed of friends' transactions)
- An app which is an addictive and frustrating video game, but while you are playing it, the company watches you through your camera, and uses the video for research and training AI models

Please include at least three values and at least five stakeholders.
