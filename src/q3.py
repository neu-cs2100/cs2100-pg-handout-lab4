This question has no starter code.

Create a class called Temperature which stores a temperature in Celsius.
It should allows users to get and set the temperature using either Celsius or Fahrenheit.

The class should:

- Store the temperature internally in Celsius as a private attribute (two underscores)
- Have a property called celsius that allows getting and setting the temperature in Celsius (@property decorator)
- Have a property called fahrenheit that allows getting and setting the temperature in Fahrenheit (@property decorator)
- Validate in the setters that temperatures are not below absolute zero (-273.15°C or -459.67°F) and raise a ValueError with an appropriate message for invalid temperatures
