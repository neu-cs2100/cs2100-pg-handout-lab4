This question has no starter code.
Write a generic class called Stack, which, like List, can store any type of data.

The class Stack should have the following methods:

push(item: T) -> None: Add an item to the top of the stack (front of the list)
pop() -> T | None: Remove and return the top item (return None if empty)
peek() -> T | None: Return the top item without removing it (return None if empty)
is_empty() -> bool: Check if the stack is empty
