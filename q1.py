This question has no starter code.
Write a generic class called Queue, which, like List, can store any type of data.

The class Queue should have the following methods:

enqueue(item: T) -> None: Add an item to the back of the queue (back of the list)
dequeue() -> T | None: Remove and return the front item (return None if empty)
peek() -> T | None: Return the front item without removing it (return None if empty)
is_empty() -> bool: Check if the queue is empty
